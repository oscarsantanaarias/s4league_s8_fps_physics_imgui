(I ADDED A LOT OF FILES IN ROOT RANDOMLY)

Hello, here is an Imgui of a setting menu for S4League, current settings working FPS UNLOCK/PHYSICS FIXED and edit, will fix the physics and unlock fps and the menu will allow you to edit in Game by pressing DEL/INS to open and close the menu, I am still working on the FOV which will be working soon.

All my settings are already here on .vs.rar make sure you add this to the project folder and you might need to change some routes since my user is different.


My route is: C:\migui\imgui 
If you create those folders and add the project there you probably won't have to change any routes.

You must install: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812 to build the dll.

I am still working on the other screen settings.
